![Cover Image](https://github.com/Brianhulela/neural_network_grades_regression/blob/master/neural_network.drawio.png)

## Overview  

This repository contains the Python implementation for building a neural network regression model to predict student grades based on factors such as socioeconomic status, study hours, sleep hours, and attendance percentage. Using TensorFlow, we preprocess the data, explore feature relationships, and train a model that forecasts grades with precision. The project demonstrates the power of machine learning in analyzing and interpreting educational data, providing valuable insights into the factors affecting student performance.
